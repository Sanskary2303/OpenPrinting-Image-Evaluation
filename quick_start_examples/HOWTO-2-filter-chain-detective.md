# HOWTO-2: CUPS Filter Chain Detective (3 minutes)

## What you'll achieve

X-ray vision into your CUPS print pipeline! See exactly what each filter does to your document, step-by-step, and identify which filter causes quality problems.

## Prerequisites

Same as HOWTO-1 - you need a virtual PDF printer (Cups-PDF on Fedora, PDF on Ubuntu).

```bash
# Verify your printer name
lpstat -p
```

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Run Filter Chain Analysis

```bash
# Use YOUR printer queue name

# Fedora/RHEL:
python filter_chain_test_pipeline.py Cups-PDF --verbose

# Ubuntu/Debian:
python filter_chain_test_pipeline.py PDF --verbose

# Or if executable:
./filter_chain_test_pipeline.py PDF --verbose
```

### Step 2: Check the Results

The test creates `filter_test_results_Virtual_PDF_Printer_[timestamp]/` containing:

- **`reports/filter_chain_test_report.html`** - Visual filter-by-filter analysis
- **`filter_outputs/`** - Output from each filter step
- **`intermediate_steps/`** - Step-by-step filter processing
- **`analysis_results/`** - Detailed metrics for each filter

## What you'll see

### Filter Chain Discovery

```text
DISCOVERED FILTER CHAIN:
Original PDF ‚Üí pdftoppm ‚Üí imagetoraster ‚Üí rastertopwg ‚Üí Final Output

Filter Details:
‚Ä¢ pdftoppm: Converts PDF to bitmap image
‚Ä¢ imagetoraster: Converts to CUPS raster format  
‚Ä¢ rastertopwg: Converts raster to PWG format
```

### Step-by-Step Quality Analysis

```text
FILTER IMPACT ANALYSIS:
Step 1 (pdftoppm):     Quality: 0.956 (Excellent)
Step 2 (imagetoraster): Quality: 0.834 (Good - some quality loss)
Step 3 (rastertopwg):   Quality: 0.789 (Acceptable)

BOTTLENECK DETECTED: imagetoraster causing 12% quality reduction
```

### Visual Filter Comparison

- **Before/After each filter** showing cumulative changes
- **Quality degradation tracking** across the filter chain
- **Problem detection** highlighting which filter causes issues
- **Processing time analysis** showing performance bottlenecks

## Advanced Options

### Fast Mode (90x faster)

```bash
# Fedora/RHEL:
python filter_chain_test_pipeline.py Cups-PDF --fast-mode

# Ubuntu/Debian:
python filter_chain_test_pipeline.py PDF --fast-mode
```

Perfect for quick checks - uses optimized algorithms.

### Test Different Printers

```bash
# List all available printers first
lpstat -p

# Then test with any printer
python filter_chain_test_pipeline.py YOUR_PRINTER_NAME
```

### Debug Mode for Deep Analysis

```bash
python filter_chain_test_pipeline.py PDF --verbose
```

## Understanding Results

### Filter Chain Health Check

- **‚úÖ Healthy Chain**: Each step maintains >85% quality
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Problematic Filter**: One step drops quality significantly  
- **üö® Broken Chain**: Multiple filters causing cumulative damage

### Key Metrics Per Filter

- **Quality Preservation**: How much image quality is maintained
- **Processing Time**: Performance impact of each filter
- **File Size Changes**: Compression/expansion effects
- **Format Conversions**: MIME type transformations

## Real-World Use Cases

### Debug Print Quality Issues

```bash
# Customer reports blurry prints - test with their printer
python filter_chain_test_pipeline.py Customer_Printer --verbose

# Result: imagetoraster filter using wrong DPI settings
# Solution: Adjust printer PPD configuration
```

### Optimize Filter Performance

```bash
# Check which filter is slowest
python filter_chain_test_pipeline.py Slow_Printer --fast-mode

# Result: pdftoppm taking 80% of processing time
# Solution: Optimize PDF processing settings
```

### Validate New Printer Setup

```bash
# Test new printer configuration
python filter_chain_test_pipeline.py New_Printer_Queue

# Result: Complete filter chain analysis
# Outcome: Verify setup before production use
```

## Performance

- **37 test images** processed through complete filter chain
- **Each filter step analyzed** individually  
- **Processing time**: 2-5 minutes (fast mode: 30 seconds)
- **Step-by-step visualization** of quality changes

## Next Steps

After seeing your filter chain analysis:

- Use results to **optimize printer configurations**  
- **Identify problematic filters** for replacement/tuning
- **Compare different printer setups** for best quality
- Try **HOWTO-3** for comprehensive document testing
