## What you'll achieve

Explore the 11 cutting-edge image analysis algorithms! See how density detection, rotation analysis, noise analysis, texture analysis, and geometric analysis work on real images.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Demo with Existing Images

```bash
python example_usage.py
```

This will automatically:

- Find PNG files in your workspace (150dpi.png, 300dpi.png, 600dpi.png)
- Run all 11 advanced algorithms on each image
- Show detailed analysis results
- Generate visualization outputs

### Step 2: Compare Two Images

```bash
python -c "
from example_usage import compare_images_with_algorithms
compare_images_with_algorithms('150dpi.png', '300dpi.png', 'dpi_comparison')
"
```

### Step 3: Check Results

Results are saved in analysis directories:

- **`analysis_[imagename]/`** - Single image analysis
- **`comparison_output/`** - Image comparison results
- **Visual outputs** showing algorithm results

## Algorithm Deep Dive

### 1. Density Detection Algorithm

**What it does**: Finds concentrated content areas vs white space

```text
Content Density: 0.2847 (28.47% of image has content)
Text Density: 0.1234 (12.34% appears to be text)
Dense Clusters: 12 (areas of concentrated content)
```

**Use case**: Detect if content is properly distributed, find text regions

### 2. Rotation Detection Algorithm

```text
Rotation Angle: 1.2° (clockwise rotation detected)
Confidence: 0.8934 (89.34% confident in detection)
Needs Correction: True (rotation > 0.5° threshold)
```

**Use case**: Auto-correct scanned documents, detect print alignment issues

### 3. Noise Analysis Algorithm

```text
Noise Level: 23.45 (moderate noise present)
Quality Rating: Good (acceptable for most uses)
SNR: 28.67 dB (signal-to-noise ratio)
```

**Use case**: Detect compression artifacts, scanner noise, print quality issues

### 4. Texture Analysis Algorithm (Optimized!)

```text
Complexity: medium-high (detailed textures present)
Contrast: 45.23 (good contrast in texture patterns)
Roughness: 0.678 (moderately rough texture)
```

**Use case**: Ensure fine details preserved, detect over-smoothing

### 5. Geometric Analysis Algorithm

```text
Aspect Ratio: 1.414 (√2 ratio - A4 paper standard)
Rectangularity: 0.9234 (shapes are well-formed rectangles)
Horizontal Symmetry: 0.823 (82.3% symmetric horizontally)
Vertical Symmetry: 0.756 (75.6% symmetric vertically)
```

**Use case**: Detect layout distortion, verify proper formatting
