# HOWTO-1: Print Quality Analysis (2 minutes)

## What you'll achieve

See exactly how your documents are affected by the print processing pipeline with detailed quality scores and visual comparisons.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Run the Print Quality Test

```bash
python print_quality_pipeline.py Virtual_PDF_Printer
```

### Step 2: Check the Results

The test will create a directory like `print_test_results_Virtual_PDF_Printer_20250928_143022/` containing:

- **`reports/print_quality_report.html`** - Visual report with before/after comparisons
- **`analysis_results/`** - JSON files with detailed metrics
- **`comparisons/`** - Side-by-side image comparisons

## What you'll see

### Impressive Quality Scores

```text
Overall Quality Score: 0.847 (84.7% preserved)
SSIM (Structural Similarity): 0.923
Edge Quality: 0.789
Color Accuracy: 0.915
```

### Automatic Problem Detection:

- ‚úÖ **Text sharpness**: Preserved well (SSIM > 0.9)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Edge detail**: Slight softening detected (12% reduction)
- ‚úÖ **Color fidelity**: Excellent preservation (91.5%)
- ‚úÖ **Feature matching**: 47 keypoints matched

### Visual Results:

- **Before/After comparisons** showing exactly what changed
- **Difference heatmaps** highlighting problem areas
- **Quality metrics per test image** (text, photos, graphics)

## üîß Customization Options

### Test with different printers:

```bash
# List available printers first
python printer_info.py

# Test with your printer
python print_quality_pipeline.py "Your_Printer_Name"
```

### Verbose mode for detailed logging:

```bash
python print_quality_pipeline.py Virtual_PDF_Printer --verbose
```

## Understanding Results

### Quality Score Interpretation:

- **0.95-1.0**: Excellent quality preservation
- **0.85-0.94**: Good quality, minor artifacts
- **0.70-0.84**: Acceptable quality, some degradation
- **< 0.70**: Poor quality, significant issues

### Key Metrics:

- **SSIM**: Structural similarity (how well shapes are preserved)
- **PSNR**: Peak signal-to-noise ratio (overall image quality)  
- **Edge Quality**: Sharpness preservation
- **Color Similarity**: Color accuracy maintenance

## ‚ö° Performance

- **37 test images** processed automatically
- **11 advanced algorithms** analyze each image
- **Complete analysis in ~2-5 minutes**
