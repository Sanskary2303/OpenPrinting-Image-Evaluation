# OpenPrinting Image Quality Evaluation

A comprehensive toolkit for evaluating print/scan job processing by comparing original and processed document images.

## Prerequisites & Setup

### Virtual PDF Printer Setup

You need a virtual PDF printer that saves output to files instead of physical printing.

#### **For Fedora/RHEL:**

```bash
# Install cups-pdf
sudo dnf install cups-pdf

# This creates a printer queue named "Cups-PDF"
# Verify it exists:
lpstat -p Cups-PDF
# Output: printer Cups-PDF is idle

# Output files will be saved in: ~/PDF/
```

#### **For Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
# Install cups-pdf
sudo apt-get install cups-pdf

# This creates a printer queue named "PDF"
# Verify it exists:
lpstat -p PDF
# Output: printer PDF is idle

# Output files will be saved in: ~/PDF/
```

#### **Finding Your Printer Queue Name:**

```bash
# List all available printers
lpstat -p

# Common names:
# - "Cups-PDF" (Fedora/RHEL with cups-pdf)
# - "PDF" (Ubuntu/Debian with cups-pdf)
# - "Virtual_PDF_Printer" (custom manual setup)
```

**Important:** Use your actual printer queue name in the commands below. Replace `Cups-PDF` with your printer name (e.g., `PDF` on Ubuntu).

## Major Features

### Edge Quality Analysis

The edge quality analysis uses multi-scale edge detection to evaluate how well fine details and contours are preserved in the printing process. This helps identify issues with:

- Loss of fine details
- Edge blurring or sharpening
- Contour discontinuities
- Line width variations

### Page Integrity Analysis

The page integrity verification system analyzes multi-page documents to detect common errors:

- Missing pages
- Duplicated pages
- Reordered pages
- Page orientation errors

The system uses feature matching to identify corresponding pages regardless of minor distortions and generates visualizations showing page mapping between reference and processed documents.
